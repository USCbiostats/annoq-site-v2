# Search Query UI

The Search page is the most important interactive part of the site.

## Main Files

```text
src/features/search/
  SearchWorkspace.tsx
  searchState.tsx
  QueryDrawer.tsx
  ResultsTable.tsx
  SummaryPanel.tsx
  StatsPanel.tsx
  FilterPanel.tsx
  DetailPanel.tsx
```

## Layout

`SearchWorkspace.tsx` renders:

- Left query drawer:
  `QueryDrawer`

- Center work area:
  Table, summary, or stats tab.

- Right drawer:
  Detail, summary, stats, or filters panel.

The left query drawer can be opened/closed. On mobile it is temporary; on desktop it is persistent.

## Query Modes

Supported query modes are typed in `src/types.ts`:

```ts
export type QueryMode =
  | 'chromosome'
  | 'vcf'
  | 'geneProduct'
  | 'rsID'
  | 'rsIDList';
```

The form UI for these modes is in:

```text
src/features/search/QueryDrawer.tsx
```

Mode-specific inputs:

- Chromosome: chromosome, start, end.
- VCF: pasted/uploaded VCF rows.
- Gene Product: gene product ID.
- rsID: one rsID.
- rsID List: pasted/uploaded rsID list.
- Keyword: hidden by default behind `ENABLE_KEYWORD_SEARCH`.

Samples are in:

```text
src/data/samples.ts
```

Keyword search is implemented in the frontend and query builder but intentionally disabled in `src/lib/config.ts`. Flip `ENABLE_KEYWORD_SEARCH` to `true` to show it in the query type menu.

## Annotation Selection

Two distinct ideas. Confusing them was
[issue #4](https://github.com/USCbiostats/annoq-site-v2/issues/4).

### Locked columns — always sent

`LOCKED_ANNOTATION_NAMES` in `src/lib/config.ts`:

```text
chr, pos
```

These are checked and disabled in the annotation tree and cannot be removed from a query. They
identify the variant, and `formatCell` builds the UCSC link on every `pos` cell out of the row's
`chr`, so losing either degrades the results table silently.

The rule is enforced in `AnnotationSelectionProvider`, which folds the locked names into every write
and into `localStorage` hydration, ordering them first so they stay the leading columns. Every
consumer — the tree, both "Clear Selection" buttons, both config uploads, the seeding effect —
writes through that provider, so the tree, the query, storage and the exported config cannot
disagree. `buildRequest` therefore requests exactly the selection and adds nothing of its own.

Toggling a parent node such as "Basic Info" off removes only its unlocked leaves, leaving `chr` and
`pos` checked and the parent indeterminate.

### Default selection — merely the initial checkbox state

When the search window mounts with nothing beyond the locked names selected, `SearchWorkspace` seeds
every "Basic Info" field:

```text
chr, pos, ref, alt, <rsid>
```

from `defaultSelectionForStore` in `src/lib/annotations.ts`, which drops any name the loaded store
does not carry as a leaf. `ref`, `alt` and the RSID field are ordinary annotations: unticking one
removes its column from the results table and from downloads.

**Resolved by name, never by annotation id.** The RSID field differs per dataset — `rs_dbSNP151` on
HRC, `rs_dbSNP` on TOPMed — and ids are renumbered by re-indexing. `findRsidField` picks the right
one from the loaded store. An id-based default list was
[issue #9](https://github.com/USCbiostats/annoq-site-v2/issues/9).

The selection persists to `localStorage` under `annoq:selectedAnnotations`. A stored selection with
any user-chosen annotation in it is never overwritten; "Clear Selection" drops back to `chr, pos` for
the rest of the session, and the defaults are seeded again on the next load.

A search with only the locked columns selected is valid — it returns a plain list of variant
positions.

## Submit Flow

1. User chooses a query mode and enters values.
2. User selects annotations.
3. `QueryDrawer.submit()` calls `submitSearch`.
4. `submitSearch` calls `buildRequest` in `src/lib/queryBuilder.ts`.
5. Search reducer receives `submit`.
6. `SearchWorkspace` detects `state.submitted` and fetches a result page.
7. The old request is aborted if still running.
8. Results are normalized and stored through `pageSuccess`.
9. Aggregate counts are fetched and merged through `pageAggsSuccess`.

## Search State

The reducer lives in:

```text
src/features/search/searchState.tsx
```

Important fields:

- `mode`
- `values`
- `filters`
- `submitted`
- `requestId`
- `page`
- `result`
- `loading`
- `error`
- `selectedRow`
- `statsField`
- `stats`
- `panel`
- `sidePanel`

`requestId` prevents late backend responses from older searches overwriting newer searches.

## Results Table

Main file:

```text
src/features/search/ResultsTable.tsx
```

Responsibilities:

- Render current result page.
- Render column headers and counts.
- Open column stats drawer.
- Add filters from column counts/filter buttons.
- Pin/unpin columns.
- Select a row to open details.
- Paginate server results.
- Download results.

Default pinned columns are defined in `ResultsTable.tsx`.

The backend returns paginated data. The default page size is from:

```text
src/lib/config.ts
```

## Filters

Filters currently mean “only return variants where these annotation fields have values.”

Filter UI exists in:

- Header filter chips in `ResultsTable.tsx`.
- Right drawer `FilterPanel.tsx`.
- Filter buttons in `SummaryPanel.tsx`.

Filter state lives in the reducer as `filters: string[]`.

Changing filters submits a new request with the same query values and selected fields.

## Summary

Main file:

```text
src/features/search/SummaryPanel.tsx
```

Shows:

- Position range.
- Selected columns.
- “With values” counts.
- Actions to filter or open stats.

Position range comes from aggregate data for `pos`.

## Stats

Main file:

```text
src/features/search/StatsPanel.tsx
```

Shows:

- Availability pie chart.
- Top values bar chart.
- Position histogram.

Charts use Recharts.

Stats are fetched in `SearchWorkspace.tsx` using `buildStatsQuery`. The selected stats field lives in `state.statsField`. If no field is selected yet, the first result column is used.

Changing the dropdown inside the Stats tab only changes the selected stats field. It does not open the right side drawer.

Opening stats from the table or summary explicitly opens the right side drawer.

## Detail Drawer

Main file:

```text
src/features/search/DetailPanel.tsx
```

Selecting a result row stores it as `state.selectedRow` and opens the right drawer.

Detail rendering uses the same cell formatter as the table where practical.

## Download

Download button lives in:

```text
src/features/search/ResultsTable.tsx
```

Download query is built by:

```text
src/lib/queryBuilder.ts
```

The backend returns a path. The frontend opens:

```text
{API_BASE}/download{returnedPath}
```

The `fields` argument must be sent as a GraphQL list, not as a quoted string.
